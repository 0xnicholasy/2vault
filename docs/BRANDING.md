# Build-in-Public & Branding Strategy

<!-- Claude Code Tooling:
  - product-manager-toolkit (skill): GTM strategy, launch planning, pricing decisions
  - cofounder (agent): Overall product-market positioning
-->

This project is a brand play first, micro-SaaS second. The content generated during the build process is worth as much as the tool itself.

---

## Name

**2Vault**

Meaning layers:
- "to vault" = the action (send content to your vault)
- "2nd vault" = second brain concept
- "tool to vault" = a tool for your vault

**Availability checklist (verify before Day 1):**
- [ ] GitHub: `2vault` or `2vault-extension`
- [ ] npm: `2vault`
- [ ] Chrome Web Store: "2Vault"
- [ ] Domain: `2vault.dev` or `2vault.app`
- [ ] X/Twitter: `@2vault` or `@2vault_app`

## Build-in-Public Content Plan

### Pre-Build (Day 0)

**X/Twitter announcement thread:**

> I bookmark 50+ links a week.
>
> I read maybe 3.
>
> Building 2Vault -- a Chrome extension that reads your bookmarks, has AI digest them, and files them into your Obsidian vault. In the right folder. With the right tags.
>
> Open source (AGPL). BYOK. Follow along.

- Hook: relatable pain point
- Stake: public commitment
- CTA: follow for updates

### During Build (Week 1-3)

| Day | Post Topic | Content Type |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Architecture diagram + why browser extension over CLI | Image + thread |
| 3-4 | "First working prototype" - article -> Obsidian note demo | Screen recording (30s) |
| 5-7 | "The hardest part: vault-aware categorization" | Technical insight thread |
| 8-10 | "DOM scraping X posts without the $100/mo API" | Technical deep-dive |
| 11-12 | "Testing on my 300 bookmarks - here's what broke" | Honest failures thread |
| 13-14 | Extension popup UI reveal + demo GIF | Product launch tease |
| 15+ | Launch post with Chrome Web Store link | Full launch |

**Key principles:**
- Show failures, not just wins (relatability > polish)
- Include code snippets (builds credibility)
- Tag relevant accounts: @nicolevanderhoeven (Obsidian YouTuber), @kepano (Obsidian CEO)
- Always use screenshots/GIFs - text-only posts don't get shares

### Launch Day

**X/Twitter launch thread:**

> Shipped: 2Vault -- AI Chrome extension that turns your bookmark graveyard into organized Obsidian knowledge.
>
> - Select a bookmark folder -> processes all URLs
> - Vault-aware categorization (uses YOUR folder structure)
> - Captures X posts + LinkedIn posts via DOM (no expensive API)
> - BYOK: bring your own Claude/OpenAI key
> - Open source (AGPL-3.0)
>
> [30-second demo GIF]
>
> Chrome Web Store: [link]
> GitHub: [link]

## Community Targets

| Platform | Target | Timeline |

## Coaching Service Tie-In

Every piece of content should subtly reinforce the coaching narrative:

**Frame as:** "I use AI to ship fast -- I teach developers to do the same"

**Connection points:**
- "This is the kind of portfolio project I help my coaching clients build"
- "Shipped in 3 weeks. Speed > perfection."
- Bio link always points to personal website (not just GitHub)
- Pinned tweet links to both 2Vault and coaching page

**Do NOT:**
- Let 2Vault become the primary brand identity
- Spend more time marketing the tool than coaching content
- Position as "Chrome extension developer" -- you're a fullstack product builder

---

## Portfolio Integration

After launch, add to personal website:

1. **Portfolio section:** New project card:
   - Screenshot of extension popup + Obsidian vault result
   - Tech stack badges (TypeScript, Chrome Extension, Claude API, Obsidian)
   - GitHub + Chrome Web Store links
   - "Built in 3 weeks" tagline

2. **Blog post:** Full build journal (see above)

3. **GitHub profile:** Pin the repo
