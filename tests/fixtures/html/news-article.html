        <h1>Global AI Chip Shortage Expected to Ease by 2026</h1>
        <p class="byline">By Michael Chen | June 20, 2025</p>

        <p>The global shortage of AI-optimized semiconductors that has constrained data center expansion for the past two years is expected to significantly ease by mid-2026, according to a new report from the Semiconductor Industry Association.</p>

        <p>The report, published Thursday, cites increased manufacturing capacity from both TSMC and Samsung, along with new foundries coming online in Arizona and Japan, as key factors that will help meet surging demand.</p>

        <h2>Current State of the Market</h2>

        <p>Demand for AI training and inference chips has far outpaced supply since the generative AI boom began in late 2022. Companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel have seen their order backlogs extend months into the future, forcing cloud providers to ration GPU access.</p>

        <p>"We've been operating under severe allocation constraints," said Sarah Johnson, VP of Infrastructure at a major cloud provider who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Our customers are waiting 6-8 months for dedicated GPU instances."</p>

        <h2>New Capacity Coming Online</h2>

        <p>TSMC's Arizona fab, which began limited production in late 2025, is expected to reach full capacity by Q3 2026. The facility will produce chips using the company's advanced 3nm process, including custom AI accelerators for major tech companies.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, Samsung's expanded Pyeongtaek campus and Rapidus's new Japanese facility are both scheduled to begin volume production of AI-class chips in early 2026.</p>

        <h2>Impact on AI Development</h2>

        <p>Industry analysts expect the increased supply to accelerate AI development across sectors. "When compute is abundant, innovation follows," said Dr. Lisa Wei, an analyst at TechInsights. "We expect to see a Cambrian explosion of AI applications once the hardware bottleneck is relieved."</p>

        <p>The easing shortage could also bring down the cost of AI inference, making AI-powered services more accessible to smaller companies and startups.</p>
